# abinit-highlighter README

This extension provides syntax highlighting for abinit input files. In the future, I plan to add
features that can validate inputs and check for issues that can cause abinit to exit immediately 
so you don't have to constantly resubmit jobs to your cluster.

## Features

Right now it's just syntax highlighting for abinit inputs, nothing more than that.

## Known Issues

I haven't spotted any yet, any help will be appreciated.

## Release Notes

### 0.1.0

Inital release, probably loaded with bugs.
